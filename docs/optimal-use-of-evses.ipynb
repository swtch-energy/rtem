Section **625.42** describes how to rate the load of EV charging. This is relevant if you plan to install more chargers than technically possible; “Electric vehicle charging loads shall be considered to be continuous loads.”, and therefore you need to follow the 80% rule. This states that continuous load must be 20% below the breaker capacity. On the other hand, Section **625.42** also states: “Where an automatic load management system is used, the maximum equipment load on a service and feeder shall be the maximum load permitted by the automatic load management system.”\nIn other words, when we want to run charging stations above 80% of line capacity, you must have an intelligent load management system to maintain control of the loads. This load management system sets limits on the charge point (EVSE) and thereby ensures the 80% rule. You can now oversubscribe breakers. The good news is that power management software such as EViDec® can be set to intelligently optimally manage the power at a circuit, panel, site, or transformer level. \nMoreover, adding EVSEs to an electrical system, needs at least a 30-day load study to protect the electrical system from potential system overload. The NEC Code **220.87** specifies that the calculation of a feeder or service load for existing installations shall be permitted to use actual maximum demand to determine the existing load under all of the following conditions:\n* 1)\tThe maximum demand data is available for a 1-year period.\n* 2)\tThe maximum demand at 125% plus the new load does not exceed the ampacity of the feeder or rating of the service.\n* 3)\tThe feeder has overcurrent protection in accordance with **240.4**, and the service has overload protection in accordance with 230.90.\n\nWe at [SWTCH](https://swtchenergy.com/) took the [RTEM](https://www.rtemhackathon.com/) data as an opportunity to:\n* 1)\tProvide a simple and consolidate approach to monitor the existing load using a data analytics approach,\n* 2)\tProvide a load management system to maximize utilizing the existing infrastructure while minimizing the installation and operation costs for potential customers,\n* 3)\tUse other available data source to support our proposed solution and propose a more realistic metric.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Data Model**\nStudy of an existing load behavior for a long period can be tricky, specially in presence of 1) different building applications, 2) dispersity in the load profiles, and 3) measurement outliers. We deployed a k-means approach to categorize the daily load profile, and to distinguish the load profiles in the different periods of a year. \nUsing k-means we would make sure there is an obvious distinguish between different daily load profile of a year, and then perform an energy study from each individual cluster. Thus by performing a partitioning k-means clustering method, the profile shape of each building can be studied specifically. The k-means is an unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering a training set ${x_1,...,x_N}$ consisting of $N$ observations of a random D-dimensional Euclidean variable $x$ into $K$ groups of equal prototype. The prototype can be defined as D-dimensional vectors of centroids $\\mu_k$ associated with the $k^{th}$ cluster, where $k=1,…,K$. The data point assignment $\\alpha$ is a set of binary indicator variables $\\alpha_{nk}∈ \\{0,1\\}$, indicates assigning of $x_n$ to the $k^{th}$ cluster, so if data point $x_n$ is assigned to cluster k then $α_{nk}=1$, otherwise $α_{n k}=0$.  \nBy defining the cost function by sum of squared distances between each data point $x_n$ to its assigned centroids vector $\\mu_k$; \n\n$$J=\\sum_{n=1}^N\\sum_{k=1}^K \\alpha_{nk⁡}(‖x_n-μ_k‖^2)$$\n\nThe goal is to minimize the distortion measure $J$ through finding i) the assignment set $\\{α_{nk}\\}$, and ii) the set of $\\{μ_k\\}$ which minimize $J$. To deploy this two-stage optimization, it is needed to initiate it with some values for the $μ_k$, and then minimize J with respect to the $α_{nk}$, while $\\mu_k$ is held fix. It can be done simply through assigning the data point to the closest cluster center with;\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\n1 & k = \\underset{j}{Argmin}\\left\\| x_n - \\mu_k \\right\\| \\\\\n0 & \\textrm{otherwise}\\\\\n\\end{matrix}\\right.\n$$\n\nand secondly, we hold $\\alpha_{nk}$ and minimize J with respect to the $μ_k$ by setting $\\partial J/ \\partial \\mu_k=0$ which yields to;\n\n$$\n\\mu_k=\\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^N \\alpha_{nk}x_n}{\\sum_{n=1}^N \\alpha_{nk}},\n$$\n\nwhere the second equation assigns each sample to its nearest centroid and the third creates new centroids by taking the mean value of all of the samples assigned to the previous centroids. The algorithm repeats it until the centroids do not move significantly.\nThe k-means always converges, but is highly dependent on the initialization of number of clusters and centroids vectors, therefore, defining distance from each data point might be a better initialization for centroids than random. To this point, we used a Silhouette analysis to find the separation distance between the resulting clusters. The silhouette illustrates a graphical measure over the distances of each point in clusters to the points in the neighboring clusters.  This enables us to assess and find the best number of clusters visually. Silhouette coefficient has a range of $[-1, 1]$, where $1$ indicates the sample is in the proper cluster and far from the neighboring clusters, and $0$ indicates that the sample is very close to the neighboring boundary of clusters and negative values designate the data point has been assigned to a wrong cluster. Thus by performing a partitioning k-means clustering shows a strong difference in daily load profiles for working days, non-working days and weekends.\n\n# **Smart EVSE Management**\nAn EVSE can be defined as a flexible and deferrable load, where you can schedule them in a different charge limit and timeslot. The SWTCH load management system ($EViDect^®$) will manage the load profile through the permissible interval and find the best working time slots at a minimum cost. This model can help users to first find the proper time for EVSEs usage and then find the optimized load profile vector for the building accumulated loads, including EVSEs. In this optimization regarding to general model, we have:\n$$\\min \\sum _{t=1}^{24} n x_{t} P_{t}$$\nSubject to.\n$$\\sum _{i=1}^{24} n_t p_{t} - x_{t} = 0 $$\n$$c_{min} < c_{t}< c_{max}$$\n$$x_{min} < x_{t}< x_{max}$$\n$$n_{min} < n_{t}< n_{max}$$\nwhere, $x$ and $n$ are the state variables representing the assigned power and number of EVSE in a location. The $p$ is the TOU energy pricing, and $c$ is the permissible capacity of a site, which is calculated using the k-means analysis. \nThe boundaries can be selected using the EVWatts database ([here](https://energetics.com/evwatts-station-dashboard)), where it gives a valid and realistic info for the current utilization time and capacity to us.
